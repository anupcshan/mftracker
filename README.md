MFTracker - Perl based Mutual Funds tracker
===========================================

Specifically developed to help me keep track of my SIP investments.

TODO
----
1. <strike>Implement minimal adding, updating and status reporting functionality.</strike>
2. Add options to analyse mutual funds to make decisions on adding new SIPs.
3. Graphical representation of portfolio details over time.
4. <strike>Put code into proper subroutines. Ultimately merge into single perl file.</strike>
