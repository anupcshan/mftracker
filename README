MFTracker - Perl based Mutual Funds tracker
===========================================

Specifically developed to help me keep track of my SIP investments.

TODO
----
1) Implement minimal adding, updating and status reporting functionality.
2) Add options to analyse mutual funds to make decisions on adding new SIPs.
3) Graphical representation of portfolio details over time.
4) Put code into proper subroutines. Ultimately merge into single perl file.
